## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

This was my first full single page project on frontend mentor (I usually did cards and components) and after finishing this challenge, I can say this was a good challenge. I have to say I got lost on naming my CSS classes the right way (I started off by deciding with the BEM naming convention but I dont I have done it the right, sorry ðŸ˜…). All in all, I still wonder if I have done the navigation the right way. 

### Continued development

I'm planning on using ReactJS for upcoming projects but I thought I could use a bit more skill in developing more complex app using Semantic HTML and CSS first. I hope to use this project as a stepping stone for the coming projects.
