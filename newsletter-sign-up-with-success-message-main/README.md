## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

 This project helped me revise how to add validation to a form using CSS and js altogether (using the :invalid CSS property).
```
.form-control input:not(:focus):invalid.error,
.form-control input:not(:focus):not(:placeholder-shown):invalid.error {
    background-color: hsla(var(--clr-primary-700-hsl), 0.2);
    border: 1px solid var(--clr-primary-700);
}
```

### Continued development

I hope to use this project as a warm up to develop on more complex app. I'm really excited to develop other projects as well but using framework like ReactJS.


### Useful resources

- [Take a look at this fantastic content on form validation by Bramus](https://www.bram.us/2021/01/28/form-validation-you-want-notfocusinvalid-not-invalid/) - This helped me add JS and CSS form validation the right way. I really liked the way that Bramus explained on how to do form validation and will use it going forward.
