## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was a really intersting challenge. The UI code was not as hard as I thought it would be. I learned how to make a toggle callout and it was a fun one. I have attached the resource I learned from below.


### Useful resources

- [Making a toggle pop](https://codepen.io/moniqueward/pen/yNGQBz) - This helped really helped me in learning how to make a toggle callout with a triangle notch on it. It's a straightforward code. If you're also looking to build a toggler, have a look. It was a huge help for me.
