## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I think what I learned in this challenge is, a good UI design should make sense to the developer. I found myself questioning many of the design choices here, and the conclusion I came to was that, this was a challenge that's made to challenge the developer, namely when it comes to patience.

The good thing was, I'm pleased with the nav and dropdowns I built here, which were different than the ones I did before. Much thanks to Kevin Powell for his tutorials!

### Continued development

Probably none!

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's FEM tutorial series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4-IK0AVhVjNDRHoXGort7sDWcna8cGPA) - This helped me in structuring my code, using CUBE CSS, and also building my mobile nav
- [Alexander Morse's PayAPI solution repo](https://github.com/Sakeran/fem-payapi-mpa) - I came across Alexander's solution on FEM and really liked what he did with his page
