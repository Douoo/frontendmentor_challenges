## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React CSS Modules

### What I learned

This is the first time that I completed a challenge with ReactJS and seems like I have a lot to improve. I basically used useState, and useEffect as the main hooks for this project. I practiced my basic skills and will expect myself to improve on this.


### Continued development

I might have overkilled on making reusable components for this small project. I was in a mess and got lost at some point. I ended up having to track and re-adjust the components and its properties that were reusable. I hope to learn from my mistake from this project and improve on the next run.
