## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

I'm not satisfied with CSS structure. I tend to use CUBE CSS some of the time but then again I've not used it during the past couple of projects. Therefore I have to practice either my CUBE CSS skill or start using BEM. As for this project, I used BEM but not in the right manner. I was a bit frustrated with work so I had to do this very quickly but I plan to update my styling in the future
