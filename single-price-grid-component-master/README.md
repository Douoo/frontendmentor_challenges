## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was a quick project to finish. It was fun building this page as its fairly easy for someone understands the basics of CSS grid. I practiced my CSS grid skills using the 'grid-template-areas' (I usually use grid-template-columns) and it made my work a lot easier, saved me a lot of time as well.
