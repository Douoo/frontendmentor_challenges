## Overview

This is a simple product preview card web page. Feel free to use it in case you have a use case that suits this type of UI.

### The challenge

The challenge was to create a web page as per the designs in the design folder.
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Desktop first, then Mobile Design

### What I learned

Creating a responsive column layout based on css grid diplay.


```css
.row {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(1fr, 1fr));
}
```


### Useful resources

- [Grid template cols](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-columns) - This helped me understand the usage of css grid template columns.
