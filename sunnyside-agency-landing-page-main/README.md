## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I might have created too many utility classes thinking about reusability and scalability but I have to say it became cluttered at the end (I even have classes that I didn't use but left in the css). I will have to work on this part of my skill.

### Continued development

I have been flexing my HTML/CSS/JS skill until now. I believe the time have come for me to dig deep and try using external frameworks (especially in css) like that of reactJS and tailwind.
