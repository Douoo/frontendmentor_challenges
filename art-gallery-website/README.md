## My process

### Built with

- SASS
- BEM
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This project has a challenging layout and it can be frustrating to make the website look exactly like the design but overall it was a fun challenge. Aside from the strange layout (the hero layout of the home page), the other layouts were basic and easy to deal with. Other that, I had to do some research on how to blend the text (at the beginning) on black and white surface so that it have some kind of invert colors that contrast on both surface.


### Continued development

This was a project I completed using SASS. Although the project is simple for the usage of such plugins, I learned a lot about the the basic usage of SASS and I find it a very intersting framework. I hope to continue building a solid foundation on it.

I also would like to rebuild this project using ReactJS and LeafletJS (for the map). We will see in the near future.
