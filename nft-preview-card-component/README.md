## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### Continued development

I developed this website with the use of CSS flexbox and not much more. Like most times, I was having a difficult time naming my style classes but I just came across the CUBE (Composition, Utility, Block Exception) CSS method of styling websites (I did so after finishing this project). 
Their official website says "CUBE CSS is a CSS methodology thatâ€™s orientated towards simplicity, pragmatism and consistency". I have to agree with them after going through their documentation. It really helps organize the styling in clean, simple and consistent manner. I just currently found about it myself. So I plan to restyle the css with CUBE CSS method after getting a solid understanding of it.
