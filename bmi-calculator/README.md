- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- VanillaJS


### What I learned

This was a tricky challenge both interms of layout design and Javascript arrangement. I felt so tired to do this project and felt low on energy. I have to push and motivate myself to get this challenge done üòÖ. Anyways, eventhough this project was kind of a noobie it took me a long time to complete it and...Oh my God, its done.

The layout organization at the end of the page made me think how I could implement it and get it visually close to the design. I tried to do that to my best. In doing so, I flexed my CSS grid area expertise. I can't say my class naming is the best but I think it is good enough for now (I need a peace of mind üòÆ‚Äçüí®).

Through the project, I learned how to make a custom radio button and rendering optional content via JS. 

### Continued development

Building on this, I will prepare myself to start using ReactJS more and more for the coming challenges.
