## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
With this challenge I learned how to do email validation, custom styling, and practice my CSS grid skill. I still can't really write my own RegEx, but luckly there's a bunch of expressions out there available for me to use ðŸ˜….
One of the things I had to spend time on was again naming and ordering my CSS classes in a manner that's descriptive and organized.


### Continued development

This was a great design to build for a coming soon landing page, and I might prefer to use this on some projects as well.

### Useful resources


- [CSS grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - had to check my go-to CSS grid resource (very helpful). I usually tend to use CSS flex but I love how grid provides more flexible and verstile features to work with.
- [CSS grid video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QSqwbSztnA) - if you're the kind of person who prefers to watch a video rather than read an article. I recommend you watch Kevin Powell's video on getting started with grid. Its simple, easy and to the point.
