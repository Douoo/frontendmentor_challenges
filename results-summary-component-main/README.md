## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Its been a while since use basic HTML5 markup for building a website so I used this project as a warm up. The project was simple but reminded me of the basics of CSS.

### Continued development

I will be focusing on building websites using ReactJS after doing a couple of more projects using the basic HTML5. This will be an exciting journey I guess.


### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://github.com/kevin-powell/results-summary-component-main) - This helped me lot in organizing my colors accordingly. I can say my method before realizing this kind of color variable organization was not so good.
