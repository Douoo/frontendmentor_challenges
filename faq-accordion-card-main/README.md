## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I learned the basic usage of css transform functions. I used translate and rotate function for positioning the images. Other than these, I used basic css properties.

### Continued development

I used the transform function for aligning and positioning the image but still I came across a couple of problems when positioning the background image. It was a bit out of layout and therefore I hardcoded the length of my card bg image (to the left of the FAQ content), which is not really recommended to do. I will look for a better solution in the future.
